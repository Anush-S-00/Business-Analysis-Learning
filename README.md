# Business-Analysis-Learning
Learning Business Analysis from scratch with a mastery-based approach. Covers problem understanding, business thinking, requirements, processes, and stakeholder analysis through step-by-step lessons, practice, and self-evaluation.

This repository documents my step-by-step journey of learning Business Analysis from absolute basics.

The goal of this repository is not just to learn concepts, but to deeply understand them through:
- Clear explanations
- Real-world practice
- Self-evaluation
- Identifying mistakes and improving from them


Each lesson follows this structure:

1. Essentials (what must be understood)
2. Detailed explanation
3. Real-world practice
4. Self-evaluation
5. Mistake analysis
6. Corrections and learnings

Only after completing all steps do I move to the next lesson.
